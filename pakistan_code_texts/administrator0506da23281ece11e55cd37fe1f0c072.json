(2) Where any expenses, other than excepted expenses are incurred by or on behalf of the Federal Government on account of a distressed seaman either for his maintenance, necessary clothing, conveyance to a proper return port, or in case of death, for his burial or otherwise in accordance with this Ordinance, those expenses, together with the wages, if any, due to the seaman, shall be a charge upon the ship, whether a Pakistani ship or not, to which the distressed seaman belonged, and shall be a debt due to the Federal Government from the master of the ship or from the owner of the ship for the time being, or, where the ship has been lost, from the person who was the owner of the ship at the time of the loss, or where the ship has been transferred to some person not being a citizen of Pakistan, either from the owner for the time being or from the person who was the owner of the ship at the time of the transfer, and also, if the ship be a ship other than a Pakistani ship, from the person, whether principal or agent, who engaged the seaman for service in the ship.

(6) Any debt which may be due to the Federal Government under this section may be recovered by any officer authorised by it in writing in this behalf from the person concerned in the same manner in which wages may be recovered by seamen. (7) For the purpose of this section, “excepted expenses” are expenses incurred in cases where the certificate of the proper authority obtained on leaving a seaman behind states, or the Federal Government is otherwise satisfied, that the cause of the seaman being left behind is desertion, disappearance, imprisonment for misconduct, or discharge from the ship on the ground of misconduct, or otherwise due to the fault of the seamen. 182.

(3) Where the master of a ship is required under this Chapter to provide for the return of a discharged seaman to a proper return port, the master may, instead of providing the seamen's passage or the expenses of his journey or of providing the seamen with means to pay his passage or those expenses, deposit with the Pakistan consular officer such sum as that officer considers sufficient to defray the expenses of the return of the seaman to a proper return port. 183. Receiving distressed seamen on ships.—(1) The master of a Pakistani ship shall receive on board his ship and afford passage and maintenance to all distressed seamen whom he is required by the Pakistan consular officer or the Shipping Master to take on board his ship, and shall during the passage provide every such distressed seaman with accommodation equal to that normally provided for the crew of the ship and subsistence proper to the rank or rating of the said distressed seaman: Provided that the master of the ship shall not be required to receive on board his ship a distressed seaman in terms of this section if the Pakistan consular officer or the Shipping Master is satisfied that accommodation is not and cannot be made available for such seaman. (2) If the master of any such ship, when required so to do under sub-section (1), fails or refuses to receive on board his ship, or to give a passage or subsistence to, or to provide for, a distressed seaman, he shall, for each offence, be liable to a fine which may extend to five thousand rupees. 184.

Provisions as to taking distressed seamen on ships.—(1) Where a distressed seaman is for the purpose of his return to a proper return port placed on board a Pakistani ship, the Pakistan consular officer or the Shipping Master by whom the seaman is so placed shall endorse on the agreement with the crew of the ship particulars of the seaman so placed on board.

What shall be evidence of distress.––In any proceeding under this Chapter, a certificate of the Federal Government, or of such officer as the Federal Government may specify in this behalf, to the effect that the seaman named therein is distressed shall be conclusive evidence that such seaman is a distressed seaman within the meaning of this Ordinance. ____________ CHAPTER 14. —PROVISIONS AND ACCOMMODATION FOR SEAMEN AND THEIR HEALTH 187.

(2) The limits of liability determined in accordance with section 542 shall apply to the aggregate of all claims subject thereto which may arise on any distinct occasion against the person or persons mentioned in the Explanation to sub-section (I) of section 535. 545. Limitation of fund and consolidation of claims against owners.—(1) where any liability is alleged to have been incurred by the owner of a vessel in respect of claims arising out of an occurrence and the aggregate of the claims exceeds or is likely to exceed the limits of liability of the owner under sections 541 or 542, then the owner may apply to the High Court for the setting up of a Limitation Fund for the total sum representing such limits of liability. (2) The High Court, to which the application is made under sub-section (1), may determine the amount of the owner’s liability and require him to deposit such amount with the High Court or furnish such security in respect of the amount as in the opinion of the High Court is satisfactory and the amount so deposited or secured shall constitute a Limitation Fund, hereinafter referred to as the Fund for the purpose of the claims referred to in sub-section (1) and shall be utilised only for the payment of such claims. (3) After the Fund has been constituted, no person entitled to claim against it shall be entitled to exercise any right against any other assets of' the owner in respect of his claim against cite Fund, if that Fund is actually available for the benefit of the claimant.

(5) Where the owner establishes that he has paid in whole or in part any claim in respect of which he can limit his liability under section 536, the High Court shall place him in the same position and to the same extent in relation to the Fund as the claimant whose claim he has paid. (6) Where the owner has established that he may at a later date be requiring to pay in whole or in part, any of the claims under this Part, which could be settled from the Fund, the High Court may notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section order that a sufficient sum may be provisionally set aside for the purpose to enable the owner to enforce his claim against the Fund at a later date in accordance with the provisions of subsection (4). (7) If the owner is entitled to make a claim against a claimant arising out of the same occurrence, their respective claims shall be set off against each other and the provisions of this Chapter shall only apply to the balance, if any. 546.
