(3) Any compensation awarded by the manager under sub-section (2) shall be deemed to be a debt mentioned in section 8, and shall rank in priority to all other debts and liabilities other than debts or liabilities due or incurred 4[to the Government]. (4) If any lessee whose lease has been so set aside or cancelled refuses or neglects to give up possession when required to do so by the manager, the manager may, without resorting to a Civil Court, enter upon the property and summarily evict therefrom the said lessee and any other person obstructing or resisting on his behalf.] 23.
