Duty to give information as to insurance.—(1) No person against whom a claim is made in respect of any liability referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 95 shall on demand by or on behalf of the person making the claim refuse to state whether or not he was insured in respect of that liability by any policy issued under provisions of this Chapter, or would have been so insured if the insurer had not avoided or cancelled the policy, nor shall he refuse, if he was or would have been so insured, to give such particulars with respect to that policy as were specified in the certificate of insurance issued in respect thereof. (2) In the event of any person becoming insolvent or making a composition or arrangement with his creditors or in the event of an order being made for the administration of the estate of a deceased person according to the law of insolvency, or in the event of a winding up order being made or a resolution for a voluntary winding up being passed with respect to any company or of a receiver or manager of the company’s business or undertaking being duly appointed or of possession being taken by or on behalf of the holders of any debentures secured by a floating charge on any property comprised in or subject to the charge, it shall be the duty of the insolvent debtor, personal representative of the deceased debtors or company, as the case may be, or the official assignee or receiver in insolvency, trustee, liquidator, receiver or manager or person in possession of the property to give at the request of any person claiming that the insolvent debtor, deceased debtor or company is under such liability to him as is covered by the provisions of this Chapter, such information as may reasonably be required by him for the purpose of ascertaining whether any rights have been transferred to and vested in him by section 97, and for the purpose of enforcing such rights, if any; and any such contract of insurance as purports whether directly or indirectly to avoid the contract or to alter the rights of the parties thereunder upon the giving of such information in the events aforesaid, or otherwise to prohibit or prevent the giving thereof in the said events, shall be of no effect. (3) If, from the information given to any person in pursuance of sub-section (2) or otherwise, he has reasonable ground for supposing that there have or may have been transferred to him under this Chapter rights against any particular insurer, that insurer shall be subject to the same duty as is imposed by the said sub-section on the persons therein mentioned. (4) The duty to give the information imposed by this section shall include a duty to allow all contracts of insurance, receipts for premiums, and other relevant documents in the possession or power of the person on whom the duty is so imposed to be inspected and copies thereof to be taken. 99. Settlement between insurers and insured persons.—(1) No settlement made by an insurer in respect of any claim which might be made by a third party in respect of any liability of the nature referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 95 shall be valid unless such third party is a party to the settlement. (2) Where a person who is insured under a policy issued for the purposes of this Chapter has become insolvent, or where, if such insured person is a company, a winding up order has been made or a resolution for a voluntary winding up has been passed with respect to the company no agreement made between the insurer and the insured person after liability has been incurred to a third party and after the commencement of the insolvency or winding up, as the case may be, nor any waiver, assignment or other disposition made by or payment made to the insured person after the commencement aforesaid shall be effective to defeat the rights transferred to the third party under this Chapter, but those rights shall be the same as if no such agreement, wavier, assignment or disposition or payment has been made. 100. Saving in respect of sections 97, 98 and 99.— (1) For the purposes of sections 97, 98 and 99 a reference to “liabilities to third parties” in relation to a person insured under any policy of insurance shall not include a reference to any liability of that person in the capacity of insurer under some other policy of insurance. (2) The provisions of sections 97, 98 and 99 shall not apply where a company is wound up voluntarily merely for the purposes of reconstruction or of an amalgamation with another company. 101. Insolvency of insured persons not to affect liability of insured or claims by third parties.—Where a certificate of insurance has been issued to the person by whom a policy has been effected, the happening in relation to any person insured by the policy of any such event as is mentioned in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of section 97 shall, notwithstanding anything in the Chapter, not effect any liability of that person of the nature referred to in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 95; but nothing in this section shall affect any rights against the insurer conferred under the provisions of section 97, 98 and 99 on the person to whom the liability was incurred. 102. Effect of death on certain causes of action. Notwithstanding anything contained in section 306 of the Succession Act, 1925 (XXXIX of 1925), the death of a person in whose favour a certificate of insurance 1* * * had been issued, if it occurs after the happening of an event which has given rise to a claim under the provisions of this Chapter, shall not be a bar to the survival of any cause of action arising out of the said event against his estate or against the insurer. 103. Effect of certificate of insurance. When an insurer has issued a certificate of insurance in respect of a contract of insurance between the insurer and the insured person, then – (a) if and so long as the policy described in the certificate has not been issued by the insurer to the insured, the insurer shall, as between himself and any other person except the insured, be deemed to have issued to the insured person a policy of insurance conforming in all respects with the description and particulars stated in such certificate; and (b) If the insurer has issued to the insured the policy described in the certificate, but the actual terms of the policy are less favorable to persons claiming under or by virtue of the policy against the insurer either directly or through the insured than the particulars of the policy as stated in the certificate, the policy shall, as between the insurer and any other person except the insured, be deemed to be in terms conforming in all respects with the particulars stated in the said certificate. 1Omitted by the Motor Vehicles (Amdt.)
