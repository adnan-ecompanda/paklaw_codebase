Incidence of taxation. (1) Save as otherwise expressly provided in the notification imposing the tax, every tax 2[assessed] on the 3[annual rental value] of buildings or lands or of both shall be leviable primarily upon the actual occupier of the property upon which the said tax is assessed, if he is the owner of the buildings or lands or holds them on a building or other lease 1[granted by or on behalf of the 4[Government] or] the 1[Board] or on a building lease from any person. (2) In any other case, the tax shall be primarily leviable as follows, namely: (a) if the property is let, upon the lessor ; (b) if the property is sub-let, upon the superior lessor ; (c) if the property is unlet, upon the person in whom the right to let the same vests. (3) On failure to recover any sum due on account of such tax from the person primarily liable, there may be recovered from the occupier of any part of the buildings or lands in respect of which the tax is due such portion of the sum due as bears to the whole amount due the same ratio which the rent annually payable by such occupier bears to the aggregate amount of rent so payable in respect of the whole of the said buildings or lands, or to the aggregate amount of the letting value thereof, if any, stated in the authenticated assessment list. (4) An occupier who makes any payment for which he is not primarily liable under this section shall, in the absence of any contract to the contrary, be entitled to be reimbursed by the person primarily liable for the payment, and, if so entitled, may deduct the amount so paid from the amount of any rent from time to time becoming due from him to such person. Assessment List. 66. Assessment list. When a tax 2[assessed] on the 3[annual rental value] of buildings or lands or both is imposed, the 1[Board] shall cause an assessment list of all buildings or lands in the cantonment, or of both, as the case may be, to be prepared in such form as the 5[Federal Government] may by rule prescribe. 67.

(2) The assessment list so authenticated shall be deposited in the office of the 1[Board], and shall there be open, free of charge, during office hours to all owners, lessees and occupiers of property comprised therein or the authorised agents of such persons, and a public notice that it is so open shall forthwith be published. 70. Evidential value of assessment list. Subject to such alterations as may thereafter be made in the assessment list under the provisions of this Chapter and to the result of any appeal made thereunder, the entries in the assessment list authenticated and deposited as provided in section 69 shall be accepted as conclusive evidence (i) for the purpose of assessing any tax imposed under this Act, of the annual value or other valuation of all buildings and lands to which such entries respectively refer, and (ii) for the purposes of any tax imposed on buildings or lands, of the amount of each such tax leviable thereon during the year to which such list relates. 71.
