Act 1 of 1865 (except s. 37), and Bom. Reg. 17 of 1827 are rep. by the Bombay Land-revenue Code, 1879 (Bom. 5 of 1879), in areas in which the latter Act is in force. 7Subs. by A.

(1) It is enacted that, in the event of the proprietary right in lands, the property of Government, being transferred to individuals, they shall be permitted to hold the lands for ever at the assessment at which they are transferred. The proprietary right in certain lands is transferred to A at an assessment of Rs.100. An exemption from higher assessment not before existing is expressly created in favour of A by enactment, and he may seek relief in the Civil Court against over-assessment. (2) It is enacted that, when a specific limit to assessment has been established and preserved, the assessment shall not exceed such specific limit. A is the owner of land worth Rs.100 for assessment. He claims to be assessed at Rs.50 only on the strength of a course of dealing with him and his predecessors under which his land has not been more highly assessed. There is no exemption not before existing created by enactment, and A’s claim is cognizable in a Civil Court. (3) It is enacted that land-revenue shall not be leviable from any land held and entered in the land-registers as exempt. A claims to hold certain land as exempt on the ground that it has been so held by him, and is so entered in the land-register. This is an exemption expressly confirmed by enactment on the ground of its being shown in a public record, and A’s claim is cognizable in a Civil Court. (4) It is enacted that the Collector shall confirm existing exemptions of all lands shown in certain maps to be exempt. A claims exemption, alleging that his land is shown in the maps to be exempt. A’s claim is cognizable in Civil Court. (5) It is enacted that assessment shall be fixed with reference to certain considerations and not with reference others. This is not an enactment creating an exemption in favour of any individual or class, and no objection to an assessment under such an enactment is cognizable in a Civil Court. 5. Saving of certain suits. Nothing in section 4 shall be held to prevent the Civil Courts from entertaining the following suits: (a) suits l[against the Government] to contest the amount claimed, or paid under protect, or recovered, as land revenue, on the ground that such amount is in excess of the amount authorized in that behalf 2[by the Provincial Government], or that such amount had, previous to such claim, payment or recovery, been satisfied, in whole or in part, or that the plaintiff, or the person whom he represents, is not the person liable for such amount; (b) suits between private parties for the purpose of establishing any private right, although it may be affected by any entry in any record of revenue-surveyor settlement or in any village-papers; (c) suits between superior holders or occupants and inferior holders or tenants regarding the dues claimed or recovered from the latter; and nothing in section 4, clause (g), shall be held to prevent the Civil Courts from entertaining suits, other than suits l[against the Government], for possession of any land being a whole survey number or a recognized share of a survey-number; 3* * * * * * * 1The original words “against Government” were first subs. by A.O.,1937 and then amended by A. O.,1961, Art. 2 (with effect from the 23rd March, 1956), to read as above. 2Subs. by A.O., 1937, for “by Govt.”. 3Third paragraph omitted by A.O., 1949, Sch. It was inserted by the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction (Amdt.) Act, 1877 (16 of 1877). 6. Bar of certain suits against Revenue-officers. Revenue-officers shall not be liable to be sued for damages in any Civil Court for any act bona-fide done or ordered to be done by them as such in pursuance of the provisions of any law for the time being in force. If any Revenue-officer absconds or does not attend when called on by his official superior, and if the Collector of the district proceeds against him or his sureties for public money, papers or property according to the provisions of any law for the time being in force, such Collector shall not be liable to pay damages or costs in any suit brought against him by such officer or sureties although it appears that a part only, or no part whatever, of the sum demanded was due from the officer so absconding or failing to attend, or that he was not in possession of the papers or property demanded of him. 7. Punishment or prosecution of Revenue-officers no bar to civil remedies. Nothing in any law for the time being in force which authorizes the punishment departmentally of any Revenue-officer for any offence or breach of duty, or which sanctions his prosecution criminally for such offence or breach, shall be held to bar any remedy which may be had in the Civil Court against such officer. 8 to 10. [Suits against Revenue-officers. Appeals from their proceedings. Power for Local Government to call for record.] Rep. by the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act, 1880 (XV of 1880). 11. Suits not to be entertained unless plaintiff has exhausted right of appeal. No Civil Court shall entertain any suit l[against the Government] on account of any act or omission of any Revenue-officer unless the plaintiff first proves that, previously to bringing his suit, he has presented all such appeals allowed by the law for the time being in force as, within the period of limitation allowed for bringing such suit, it was possible to present. 12. Power of Government to refer questions for decision of High Court.-If, in the trial or investigation of any suit, claim or objection which, but for the passing of this Act, might have been tried or investigated by a Civil Court, there arises any question on which 1* * * the 2[Provincial Government] desires to have the decision of the 3[High Court], 4* * * the 2[Provincial Government] 5* * * may cause a statement of the question to be prepared, and may refer such question for the decision of the 6[High Court]. The 7[High Court] shall fix an early day for the hearing of the question referred, and cause notice of such day to be placed in the court-house. The parties to the case may appear and be heard in the 3[High Court] in person or by their advocates or pleaders. The 3[High Court] when it has heard and considered the case, shall send a copy of its decision, with the reasons therefor, under the seal of the Court, to the Government by which the reference was made, and, subject to any appeal which may be presented to 8[the Supreme Court], the case shall be disposed of conformably to such decision. lThe words “the G.

If in any suit instituted, or in any appeal presented, in a Civil Court, the Judge doubts whether he is precluded by this Act from taking cognizance of the suit or appeal, he may refer the matter to the 1[High Court]. The 1[High Court] may order the Judge making the reference either to proceed with the case or to return the plaint. The order of the 1[High Court] on any such reference shall be subject to appeal to 2[the Supreme Court], and, save as aforesaid, shall be final. 14. Composition of Bench.
