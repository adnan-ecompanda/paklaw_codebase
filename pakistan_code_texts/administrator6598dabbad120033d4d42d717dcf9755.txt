THE FIRST SCHEDULE (See section 121) ORDER I PARTIES TO SUITS 1. Who may be joined as plaintiffs. All Persons may be joined in one suit as plaintiffs in whom any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same act or transaction or series of acts or transactions is alleged to exist, whether jointly, severally or in the alternative, where, if such persons brought separate suits, any common question of law or fact would arise. 2. Power of Court to order separate trials. Where it appears to the Court that any joinder of plaintiffs may embarrass or delay the trial of the suit, the Court may put the plaintiffs to their election or order separate trials or make such other order as may be expedient. 3. Who may be joined as defendants. All persons may be joined as defendants against whom any right to relief in respect of or arising out of the same act or transaction or series of acts or transactions is alleged to exist, whether jointly, severally or in the alternative, where, if separate suits were brought against such persons, any common question of law or fact would arise. 4. Court may give judgement for or against one or more of joint parties. Judgment may be given without any amendment (a) for such one or more of the plaintiffs as may be found to be entitled to relief, for such relief as he or they may be entitled to; (b) against such one or more of the defendants as may be found to be liable, according to their respective liabilities. 5. Defendant need not be interested in all the relief claimed. It shall not be necessary that every defendant shall be interested as to all the relief claimed in any suit against him. 6. Joinder of parties liable on same contract. The plaintiff may, at his option, join as parties to the same suit all or any of the persons severally, or jointly and severally, liable on any one contract, including parties to bills of exchange, hundis and promissory notes. 7. When plaintiff in doubt from whom redress is to be sought. Where the plaintiff is in doubt as to the person from whom he is entitled to obtain redress, he may join two or more defendants in order that the question as to which of the defendants is liable, and to what extent, may be determined as between all parties. 8. One person may sue or defend on behalf of all in same interest. (1) Where there are numerous persons having the same interest in one suit, one or more of such persons may, with the permission of the Court, sue or be sued, or may defend, in such suit, on behalf of or for the benefit of all persons so interested. But the Court shall in such case give, at the plaintiff's expense, notice of the institution of the suit to all such persons either by personal service or, where from the number of persons or any other cause such service is not reasonably practicable, by public advertisement, as the Court in each case may direct. (2) Any person on whose behalf or for whose benefit a suit is instituted or defended under sub- rule (1) may apply to the Court to be made a party to such suit. 9. Misjoinder and nonjoinder. No suit shall be defeated by reason of the misjoinder or non- joinder of parties, and the Court may in every suit deal with the matter in controversy so far as regards the rights and interests of the parties actually before it. 10. Suit in name of wrong plaintiff. (1) Where a suit has been instituted in the name of the wrong person as plaintiff or where it is doubtful whether it has been instituted in the name of the right plaintiff, the Court may at any stage of the suit, if satisfied that the suit has been instituted through a bona fide mistake, and that it is necessary for the determination of the real matter in dispute so to do, order any other person to be substituted or added as plaintiff upon such terms as the Court thinks just. (2) Court may strike out or add parties. The Court may at any stage of the proceedings, either upon or without the application of either party, and on such terms as may appear to the Court to be just, order that the name of any party improperly joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant, be struck out, and that the name of any person who ought to have been joined, whether as plaintiff or defendant, or whose presence before the Court may be necessary in order to enable the Court effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the suit, be added. (3) No person shall be added as a plaintiff suing without a next friend or as the next friend of a plaintiff under any disability without his consent. (4) Where defendant added, plaint to be amended. Where a defendant is added, the plaint shall, unless the Court otherwise directs, be amended in such manner as may be necessary, and amended copies of the summons and of the plaint shall be served on the new defendant and, if the Court thinks fit, on the original defendant. (5) Subject to the provisions of the 1[Limitation Act, 1908 (IX of 1908)], section 22, the proceedings as against any person added as defendant shall be deemed to have begun only on the service of the summons. 11. Conduct of suit. The Court may give the conduct of the suit to such person as it deems proper. 12. Appearance of one of several plaintiffs of defendants for others. (1) where there are more plaintiffs than one, any one or more of them may be authorized by any other of them to appear, plead or act for such other in any proceeding ; and in like manner, where there are more defendants than one, any one or more of them may be authorized by any other of them to appear, plead or act for such other in any proceeding. (2) The authority shall be in writing signed by the party giving it and shall be filed in Court. 13. Objections as to non-joinder or misjoinder. All objections on the ground of non-joinder or misjoinder of parties shall be taken at the earliest possible opportunity and, in all cases where issues are settled, at or before such settlement, unless the ground of objection has subsequently arisen, and any such objection not so taken shall be deemed to have been waived. 1Subs. by the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration) Ordinance, 1981 (27 of 1981), s.3 and Second Sch., for “Indian Limitation Act, 1877 (15 of 1877)”. ORDER II FRAME OF SUIT 1. Frame of suit. Every suit shall as far as practicable be framed so as to afford ground for final decision upon the subjects in dispute and to prevent further litigation concerning them. 2. Suit to include the whole claim. (1) Every suit shall include the whole of the claim which the plaintiff is entitled to make in respect of the cause of action; but a plaintiff may relinquish any portion of his claim in order to bring the suit within the jurisdiction of any Court. (2) Relinquishment of part of claim. Where a plaintiff omits to sue in respect of, or intentionally relinquishes, any portion of his claim, he shall not afterwards sue in respect of the portion so omitted or relinquished. (3) Omission to sue for one of several reliefs. A person entitled to more than one relief in respect of the same cause of action may sue for all or any of such reliefs ; but if he omits, except with the leave of the Court, to sue for all such reliefs, he shall not afterwards sue for any relief so omitted. Explanation. For the purposes of this rule an obligation and a collateral security for its performance and successive claims arising under the same obligation shall be deemed respectively to constitute but one cause of action.

Dates, sums and numbers shall be expressed in figures. 3. Forms of pleading. The forms in Appendix A when applicable, and where they are not applicable forms of the like character, as nearly as may be, shall be used for all pleadings. 4.

Whenever any contract or any relation between any persons is to be implied from a series of letters or conversations or otherwise from a number of circumstances, it shall be sufficient to allege such contract or relation as a fact, and to refer generally to such letters, conversations or circumstances without setting them out in detail. And if in such case the person so pleading desires to rely in the alternative upon more contracts or relations than one as to be implied from such circumstances, he may state the same in the alternative. 13. Presumptions of law. Neither party need in any pleading allege any matter of fact which the law presumes in his favour or as to which the burden of proof lies upon the other side unless the same has first been specifically denied (e.g., consideration for a bill of exchange where the plaintiff sues only on the bill and not for the consideration as a substantive ground of claim). 14. Pleading to be signed. Every pleading shall be signed by the party and his pleader (if any): Provided that where a party pleading is, by reason of absence or for other good cause, unable to sign the pleading, it may be signed by any person duly authorized by him to sign the same or to sue or defend on his behalf. 15. Verification of pleadings. (1) Save as otherwise provided by any law for the time being in force, every pleading shall be verified 1[on oath or solemn affirmation] at the foot by the party or by one of the parties pleading or by some other person proved to the satisfaction of the Court to be acquainted with the facts of the case. (2) The person verifying shall specify, by reference to the numbered paragraphs of the pleading, what he verifies of his own knowledge and what he verifies upon information received and believed to be true. (3) The verification shall be signed by the person making it and shall state the date on which and the place at which it was signed. 1Ins. by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972), s.2 and Sch. 16. Striking out pleadings. The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any matter in any pleading which may be unnecessary or scandalous or which may tend to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the suit. 17. Amendment of pleadings. The Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just, and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties. 18. Failure to amend after order. If a party who has obtained an order for leave to amend does not amend accordingly within the time limited for that purpose by the order, or if no time is thereby limited then within fourteen days from the date of the order, he shall not be permitted to amend after the expiration of such limited time as aforesaid or of such fourteen days, as the case may be, unless the time is extended by the Court. ORDER VII PLAINT 1. Particulars to be contained in plaint. The plaint shall contain the following particulars: (a) the name of the Court in which the suit is brought; (b) the name, description and place of residence of the plaintiff; (c) the name, description and place of residence of the defendant, so far as they can be ascertained; (d) where the plaintiff or the defendant is a minor or a person of unsound mind, a statement to that effect; (e) the facts constituting the cause of action and when it arose; (f) the facts showing that the Court has jurisdiction; (g) the relief which the plaintiff claims; (h) where the plaintiff has allowed a set-off or relinquished a portion of his claim, the amount so allowed or relinquished; and (i) a statement of the value of the subject-matter of the suit for the purposes of jurisdiction and of court-fees, so far as the case admits. 2. In money suits. Where the plaintiff seeks the recovery of money, the plaint shall state the precise amount claimed: But where the plaintiff sues for mesne profits, or for an amount which will be found due to him on taking unsettled accounts between him and the defendant, the plaint shall state approximately the amount sued for. 3. Where the subject-matter of the suit is immoveable property. Where the subject-matter of the suit is immoveable property, the plaint shall contain a description of the property sufficient to identify it, and, in case such property can be identified by boundaries or numbers in a record of settlement of survey, the plaint shall specify such boundaries or numbers. 4. When plaintiff sues as representative. Where the plaintiff sues in a representative character the plaint shall show not only that he has an actual existing interest in the subject-matter, but that he has taken the steps (if any) necessary to enable him to institute a suit concerning it. 5. Defendant`s interest and liability to be shown. The plaint shall show that the defendant is or claims to be interested in the subject-matter, and that he is liable to be called upon to answer the plaintiff's demand. 6. Grounds of exemption from limitation law. Where the suit is instituted after the expiration of the period prescribed by the law of limitation, the plaint shall show the ground upon which exemption from such law is claimed. 7. Relief to be specifically stated. Every plaint shall state specifically the relief which the plaintiff claims either simply or in the alternative, and it shall not be necessary to ask for general or other relief which may always be given as the Court may think just to the same extent as if it had been asked for. And the same rule shall apply to any relief claimed by the defendant in his written statement. 8. Relief founded on separate grounds. Where the plaintiff seeks relief in respect of several distinct claims or causes of action founded upon separate and distinct grounds, they shall be stated as far as may be separately and distinctly. 9. Procedure of admitting plaint. 1[(1)The plaintiff shall endorse on the plaint, or annex thereto, a list of the documents (if any) which he has produced along with it. (1A) The plaintiff shall present with his plaint (a) as many copies on plain paper of the plaint as there are defendants, plus two extra copies, unless the Court, by reason of the length of the plaint or the number of the defendants, or for any other sufficient reason, permits him to present a like number of concise statements of the nature of the claim made, or of the relief claimed in the suit, in which case he shall present such statements; and (b)  forms of summons and fees for the service thereof.] (2) Concise statements. Where the plaintiff sues, or the defendant or any of the defendants is sued, in a representative capacity, such statements shall show in what capacity the plaintiff or defendant sues or is sued. (3) The plaintiff may, by leave of the Court, amend such statements so as to make them correspond with the plaint. (4) The chief ministerial officer of the Court shall sign such list and copies or statements if, on examination, he finds them to be correct. 1Subs. by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972), s.2 and Sch., for the original sub-rule (1). 10. Return of plaint. (1) The plaint shall at any stage of the suit be returned to be presented to the Court in which the suit should have been instituted. (2) Procedure on returning plaint. On returning a plaint the Judge shall endorse thereon the date of its presentation and return, the name of the party presenting it, and a brief statement of the reasons for returning it. 11. Rejection of plaint. The plaint shall be rejected in the following cases: (a) where it does not disclose a cause of action: (b) where the relief claimed is under valued, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so: (c) where the relief claimed is properly valued, but the plaint is written upon paper insufficiently stamped, and the plaintiff, on being required by the Court to supply the requisite stamp-paper within a time to be fixed by the Court, fails to do so: (d) where the suit appears from the statement in the plaint to be barred by any law. 12. Procedure on rejecting plaint. Where a plaint is rejected the Judge shall record an order to that effect with the reasons for such order. 13. Where rejection of plaint does not preclude presentation of fresh plaint. The rejection of the plaint on any of the grounds hereinbefore mentioned shall not of its own force preclude the plaintiff from presenting a fresh plaint in respect of the same cause of action. Documents relied on in Plaint 14. Production of document on which plaintiff sues. (1) Where a plaintiff sues upon a document in his possession or power, he shall produce it in Court when the plaint is presented, and shall at the same time deliver the document or a copy thereof to be filed with the plaint. (2) List of other documents. Where he relies on any other documents (whether in his possession or power or not) as evidence in support of his claim, he shall enter such documents in a list to be added or annexed to the plaint. 15. Statement in case of documents not in plaintiff’s possession or power. Where any such document is not in the possession or power of the plaintiff, he shall, if possible, state in whose possession or power it is. 16. Suits on last negotiable instruments. Where the suit is founded upon a negotiable instrument, and it is proved that the instrument is lost, and an indemnity is given by the plaintiff, to the satisfaction of the Court, against the claims of any other person upon such instrument, the Court may pass such decree as it would have passed if the plaintiff had produced the instrument in Court when the plaint was presented, and had at the same time delivered a copy of the instrument to be filed with the plaint. 17. Production of shop-book. (1) Save in so far as is otherwise provided by the Bankers’ Books Evidence Act, 1891 (XVIII of 1891), where the document on which the plaintiff sues is an entry in a shop-book or other account in his possession or power the plaintiff shall produce the book, or account at the time of filing the plaint, together with a copy of the entry on which he relies. (2) Original entry to be marked and returned. The Court, or such officer as it appoints in this behalf shall forthwith mark the document for the purpose of identification; and, after examining and comparing the copy with the original, shall, if it is found correct, certify it to be so and return the book, to the plaintiff and cause the copy to be filed. 18. Inadmissibility of document not produced when plaint filed. (1) A document which ought to be produced in Court by the plaintiff when the plaint is presented, or to be entered in the list to be added or annexed to the pliant, and which is not produced, or entered accordingly, shall not, without the leave of the Court, be received in evidence on his behalf at the hearing of the suit. (2) Nothing in this rule applies to documents produced for cross-examination of the defendant’s witnesses, or in answer to any case set up by the defendant or handed to a witness merely to refresh his memory. 1[19. Address to be filed with plaint. (1) Every plaint or original petition shall be accompanied by a proceeding giving an address at which service of notice, summons or other process may be made on the plaintiff or petitioner. (2) Plaintiffs or petitioners subsequently added shall immediately on being so added file a proceeding of this nature. (3) The address filed under this rule shall be entered in the Register of suits maintained under Order IV, rule 2. 20. Nature of address to be filed. An address for service filed under the preceding rule shall be within the local limits of the District Court within which the suit or petition is filed, or of the District Court within which the party ordinarily resides. 21. Consequences of failure to file address. Where a plaintiff or petitioner fails to file an address for service 2[the court may direct him to file such address and if he fails to do so after giving him opportunity], he shall be liable to have his suit dismissed or his petition rejected by the Court suo moto or any party may apply for an order to that effect, and the Court may make such order as it thinks just. 22. Procedure when party not found at the place of address. (1) Where a party is not found at the address given by him for service and no agent or adult male member of his family on whom a notice, summons or other process can be served is present, a copy of the notice, summons or other process shall be fixed to the outer door of the house. (2) If, on the date fixed, such party is not present, another date shall be fixed and a copy of the notice, summons or other process shall be sent to the said address by registered post, and such service shall be deemed to be as effectual as if the notice, summons or other process had been personally served. 1Rules 19 to 26 added by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972), s.2 and Sch. 2Added by S.R.O. 579(1)/2014, dt: 18-6-2014. 23. Service on pleader. Where a party engages a pleader, notices, summons or other processes for service on him shall be served in the manner prescribed by Order III, rule 5, unless the Court directs service at the address for service given by the party. 24. Change of address. A party who desires to change the address for service given by him as aforesaid shall file a verified petition, and the Court may direct the amendment of the record accordingly. Notice of such petition shall be given to such other parties to the suit as the Court may deem it necessary to inform, and may be either served upon the pleaders for such parties or be sent to them by registered post, as the Court thinks fit. 25. Service by other modes. Nothing in these rules shall prevent the Court from directing the service of a notice, summons or other process in any other manner, if, for any reasons, it thinks fit to do so. 26. List of legal representatives of Plaintiff. (1) In every suit of the nature referred to in rule 3, Order XXII, the plaint shall be accompanied by a statement giving (a) the names and addresses of the persons whom, in the event of the death of the plaintiff, may be made a party as his legal representatives; (b) the name and address of the person who, in the event of the death of the plaintiff, shall intimate such fact to the Court, furnish the Court with the names, particulars and addresses of the legal representatives of the plaintiff and make an application for the legal representatives to be made a party. (2) A plaintiff may at any time (a) file in the Court an amended list, of his presumptive legal representatives; (b) nominate another person, in the place of the person nominated under clause (b) of sub-rule (1), for the purposes of that clause. (3) A nomination made under clause (b) of sub-rule (1) shall, unless varied under clause (b) of sub-rule (2) remain in force throughout the pendency of the suit and any proceedings arising therefrom, including appeal, revision and review.]. ORDER VIII WRITTEN STATEMENT AND SET-OFF 1. Written statement. The defendant may, and, if so required by the Court, shall, at or before the first hearing or within such time as the Court may permit, present a written statement of his defence [:]1 2[Provided that the period allowed for filing the written statement shall not ordinarily exceed 3[thirty] days.] 1Subs. by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972), s.2 and Sch. for full-stop. 2Proviso added ibid. 3Subs. by Act. XIV of 1994, S.11. 2. New facts must be specially pleaded. The defendant must raise by his pleading all matters, which show the suit not to be maintainable, or that the transaction is either void or voidable in point of law, and all such grounds of defence as, if not raised, would be likely to take the opposite party by surprise, or would raise issues of fact not arising out of the plaint, as, for instance, fraud, limitation, release, payment, performance, or facts showing illegality. 3. Denial to be specific. It shall not be sufficient for a defendant in his written statement to deny generally the grounds alleged by the plaintiff, but the defendant must deal specifically with each allegation of fact of which he does not admit the truth, except damages. 4. Evasive denial. Where a defendant denies an allegation of fact in the plaint, he must not do so evasively, but answer the point of substance. Thus, if it is alleged that he received a certain sum of money, it shall not be sufficient to deny that he received that particular amount, but he must deny that he received that sum or any part thereof, or else set out how much he received. And if an allegation is made with diverse circumstances, it shall not be sufficient to deny it along with those circumstances. 5. Specific denial. Every allegation of fact in the plaint, if not denied specifically or by necessary implication, or stated to be not admitted in the pleading of the defendant, shall be taken to be admitted except as against a person under disability: Provided that the Court may in its discretion require any fact so admitted to be proved otherwise than by such admission. 6. Particular of set-off to be given in written statement. (1) Where in a suit for the recovery of money the defendant claims to set-off against the plaintiff's demand any ascertained sum of money legally recoverable by him from the plaintiff, not exceeding the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the Court, and both parties fill the same character as they fill in the plaintiff's suit, the defendant may, at the first hearing of the suit, but not afterwards unless permitted by the Court, present a written statement containing the particulars of the debt sought to be set-off. (2) Effect of Set-off. The written statement shall have the same effect as a plaint in a cross-suit so as to enable the Court to pronounce a final judgement in respect both of the original claim and of the set-off: but this shall not affect the lien, upon the amount decreed, of any pleader in respect of the costs payable to him under the decree. (3) The rules relating to a written statement by a defendant apply to a written statement in answer to a claim of set-off. Illustrations (a) A bequeaths Rs.2,000 to B and appoints C his executor and residuary legatee. B dies and D takes out administration to B's effect. C pays Rs.1,000 as surety for D: then D sues C for the legacy. C cannot set-off the debt of Rs.1,000 against the legacy, for neither C nor D fills the same character with respect to the legacy as they fill with respect to the payment of the Rs.1,000. (b) A dies intestate and in debt to B.C takes out administration to A's effects and B buys part of the effects from C. In a suit for the purchase- money by C against B, the latter cannot set- off the debt against the price, for C fills two different characters, one as the vendor to B, in which he sues B, and the other as representative to A. (c) A sues B on a bill of exchange. B alleges that A has wrongfully neglected to insure B’s goods and is liable to him in compensation which he claims to set-off. The amount not being ascertained cannot be set-off. (d) A sues B on a bill of exchange for Rs.500, B holds a judgment against A for Rs.1,000. The two claims being both definite pecuniary demands may be set-off. (e) A sues B for compensation on account of trespass. B holds a promissory note for Rs.1,000 from A and claims to set-off that amount against any sum that A may recover in the suit. B may do so for, as soon as A recovers, both sums as definite pecuniary demands. (f) A and B sue C for Rs.1,000, C cannot set-off a debt due to him by A alone. (g) A sues B and C for Rs.1,000. B cannot set-off a debt due to him alone by A. (h) A owes the partnership firm of B and C Rs.1,000. B dies, leaving C surviving. A sues C for a debt of Rs.1,500 due in his separate character. C may set-off the debt of Rs.1,000. 7. Defence or set-off founded on separate grounds. Where the defendant relies upon several distinct grounds of defence or set-off founded upon separate and distinct facts, they shall be stated, as far as may be, separately and distinctly. 8. New ground of defence. Any ground of defence which has arisen after the institution of the suit or the presentation of a written statement claiming a set-off may be raised by the defendant or plaintiff, as the case may be, in his written statement. 9. Subsequent Pleadings. No pleading subsequent to the written statement of a defendant other than by way of defence to a set-off shall be presented except by the leave of the Court and upon such terms as the Court thinks fit, but the Court may at any time require a written statement or additional written statement from any of the parties and fix a time for presenting the same. 10. Procedure when party fails to present written statement called for by Court. Where any party from whom a written statement is so required fails to present the same within the time fixed by Court, the Court may pronounce judgment against him, or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. 1[11. Address for service. (1) Every party, whether original, added or substituted, who appears in any suit or other proceeding, shall, on or before the date fixed in the summons, notice or other process served on him, file in Court a proceeding stating his address for service. (2) Such address shall be entered in the Register of suits to be maintained under Order IV, rule 2. (3) Rules 20, 23, 24 and 25 of Order VII shall apply, so far as may be, to addresses for service filed under this rule. 1Rules 11, 12 and 13 added by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972) s.2 and Sch. 12. Consequences of failure to file address. (1) Where a party fails to file an address for service as provided in the preceding rule, 1[the court may direct him to file such address and if he fails to do so after giving him opportunity to file the address] he shall be liable to have his defence, if any, struck out and to be placed in the same position as if he had not defended. (2) The Court may pass an order under sub-rule (1) suo moto or on the application of any party. 13. List of legal representatives of defendant. (1) In every suit of the nature referred to in rule 4, Order XXII, the written statement shall be accompanied by a statement giving (a) the names and addresses of the persons who, in the event of the death of the defendant, may be made a party as his legal representatives; (b) the name and address of the person, who in the event of the death of the defendant, shall intimate such fact to the Court, furnish the Court with the names, particulars and addresses of the legal representatives of the defendant and make an application for the legal representatives to be made a party. (2) A defendant may at any time (a) file in the Court an amended list of his presumptive legal representatives. (b) nominate another person, in the place of the person nominated under clause (b) of sub-rule (1), for the purposes of that clause. (3) A nomination made under clause (b) of sub-rule (1) shall, unless varied under clause (b) of sub- rule (2), remain in force throughout the pendency of the suit and any proceedings arising therefrom, including appeal, revision or review.] ORDER IX APPEARANCE OF PARTIES AND CONSEQUENCE OF NON-APPEARANCE 1. Parties to appear on day fixed in summons for defendant to appear and answer. On the day fixed in the summons for the defendant to appear and answer, the parties shall be in attendance at the Court-house in person or by their respective pleaders, and the suit shall then be heard unless the hearing is adjourned to a future day fixed by the Court. 2. Dismissal of suit where summons not served in consequence of plaintiff’s failure to pay costs. Where on the day so fixed it is found that the summons has not been served upon the defendant in consequence of the failure of the plaintiff to pay the court-fee or postal charges (if any) chargeable for such service, the Court may make an order that the suit be dismissed: Provided that no such order shall be made although the summons has not been served upon the defendant, if on the day fixed for him to appear and answer he attends in person or by agent when he is allowed to appear by agent. 1Added by SRO 579(1)/2014, dated 18-06-2014 3. Where neither party appears, suit to be dismissed. Where neither party appears when the suit is called on for hearing, the Court may make an order that the suit be dismissed. 4. Plaintiff may bring fresh suit or Court may restore suit to file. Where a suit is dismissed under rule 2 or rule 3, the plaintiff may (subject to the law of limitation) bring a fresh suit; or he may apply for an order to set the dismissal aside, and if he satisfies the Court that there was sufficient cause for his not paying the court-fee and postal charges (if any) required within the time fixed before the issue of the summons, or for his non-appearance, as the case may be, the Court shall make an order setting aside the dismissal and shall appoint a day for proceeding with the suit. 5. Dismissal of suit where plaintiff, after summons returned unserved, fails for three months to apply for fresh summons. 1[(1) Where, after a summons has been issued to the defendant, or to one of several defendants, and returned unserved, the plaintiff fails, for a period of three months from the date of the return made to the Court by the officer ordinarily certifying to the Court returns made by the serving officers, to apply for the issue of a fresh summons the Court shall make an order that the suit be dismissed as against such defendant, unless the plaintiff has within the said period satisfied the Court that (a) he has failed after using his best endeavours to discover the residence of the defendant who has not been served, or (b) such defendant is avoiding service of process, or (c) there is any other sufficient cause for extending the time, in which case the Court may extend the time for making such application for such period as it thinks fit.] (2) In such case the plaintiff may (subject to the law of limitation) bring a fresh suit. 6. Procedure when only plaintiff appears. (1) Where the plaintiff appears and the defendant does not appear when the suit is called on for hearing, then (a) When summons duly served. if it is proved that the summons was duly served, the Court may proceed ex parte 2[and pass decree without recording evidence;] (b) When summons not duly served. if it is not proved that the summons was duly served, the Court shall direct a second summons to be issued and served on the defendant; (c) When summons served, but not in due time. if it is proved that the summons was served on the defendant, but not in sufficient time to enable him to appear and answer on the day fixed in the summons, the Court shall postpone the hearing of the suit to a future day to be fixed by the Court, and shall direct notice of such day to be given to the defendant. (2) Where it is owing to the plaintiff's default that the summons was not duly served or was not served in sufficient time, the Court shall order the plaintiff to pay the costs occasioned by the postponement. 7. Procedure where defendant appears on day of adjourned hearing and assigns good cause for previous non-appearance. Where the Court has adjourned the hearing of the suit ex-parte, and the defendant, at or before such hearing, appears and assigns good cause for his previous non- 1Subs. by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amdt.) Act, 1920 (24 of 1920), s.2, for the original sub-rule (1). 2Ins. by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972), s.2 and Sch. appearance, he may, upon such terms as the Court directs as to costs or otherwise, be heard in answer to the suit as if he had appeared on the day fixed for his appearance. 8. Procedure where defendant only appears. Where the defendant appears and the plaintiff does not appear when the suit is called on for hearing, the Court shall make an order that the suit be dismissed, unless the defendant admits the claim, or part thereof, in which case the Court shall pass a decree against the defendant upon such admission, and, where part only of the claim has been admitted, shall dismiss the suit so far as it relates to the remainder. 9. Decree against plaintiff by default bars fresh suit. (1) Where a suit is wholly or partly dismissed under rule 8, the plaintiff shall be precluded from bringing a fresh suit in respect of the same cause of action. But he may apply for an order to set the dismissal aside, and if he satisfies the Court that there was sufficient cause for his non-appearance when the suit was called on for hearing, the Court shall make an order setting aside the dismissal upon such terms as to costs or otherwise as it thinks fit, and shall appoint a day for proceeding with the suit. (2) No order shall be made under this rule unless notice of the application has been served on the opposite party. 1(3) The provisions of section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1908 (IX of 1908), shall apply to applications under sub-rule (1)]. 10. Procedure in case of non-attendance of one or more of several plaintiffs. Where there are more plaintiffs than one, and one or more of them appear, and the others do not appear, the Court may, at the instance of the plaintiff or plaintiffs appearing, permit the suit to proceed in the same way as if all the plaintiffs had appeared, or make such order as it thinks fit. 11. Procedure in case of non-attendance of one or more of several defendants. Where there are more defendants than one, and one or more of them appear, and the others do not appear, the suit shall proceed, and the Court shall, at the time of pronouncing judgment, make such order as it thinks fit with respect to the defendants who do not appear. 12. Consequence of non-attendance, without sufficient cause shown, of party ordered to appear in person. Where a plaintiff or defendant, who has been ordered to appear in person, does not appear in person, or show sufficient cause to the satisfaction of the Court for failing so to appear, he shall be subject to all the provisions of the foregoing rules applicable to plaintiffs and defendants, respectively, who do not appear. Setting aside Decree Ex Parte 2[13. Setting aside decree ex-parte against defendant. (1)] In any case in which a decree is passed ex parte against a defendant, he may apply to the Court by which the decree was passed for an order to set it aside; and if he satisfies the Court that the summons was not duly served, or that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from appearing when the suit was called on for hearing, the Court shall make an order setting aside the decree as against him upon such terms as to costs, payment into Court or otherwise as it thinks fit, and shall appoint a day for proceeding with the suit: Provided that where the decree is of such a nature that it cannot be set aside as against such defendant only it may be set aside as against all or any of the other defendants also [:]3 3[Provided further that no decree passed ex parte shall be set aside merely on the ground of any irregularity in the service of summons, if the Court is satisfied, for reason to be recorded, that the defendant had knowledge of the date of hearing in sufficient time to appear on that date and answer the claim.] 1New sub-rule (3) added by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amdt.) Ordinance, 1980 (10 of 1980), s. 14. 2Rule 13 re-numbered as sub-rule (1) of that rule by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amdt.)

No decree to be set aside without notice to opposite party. No decree shall be set aside on any such application as aforesaid unless notice thereof has been served on the opposite party. ORDER X EXAMINATION OF PARTIES BY THE COURT 1. Ascertainment whether allegations in pleadings are admitted or denied. At the first hearing of the suit the Court shall ascertain from each party or his pleader whether he admits or denies such allegations of fact as are made in the plaint or written statement (if any) of the opposite party, and as are not expressly or by necessary implication admitted or denied by the party against whom they are made. The Court shall record such admissions and denials. 2[1A. The Court may adopt any lawful procedure not inconsistent with the provisions of this Code to (i) Conduct preliminary proceedings and issue orders for expediting processing of the case; (ii) issue, with the consent of parties, commission to examine witnesses, admit documents and take other steps for the purpose of trial; (iii) adopt, with the consent of parties, any alternative method of dispute resolution including mediation, conciliation or any such other means.] 2. Oral examination of party or companion of party. At the first hearing of the suit, or at any subsequent hearing, any party appearing in person or present in Court, or any person able to answer any material questions relating to the suit by whom such party or his pleader is accompanied, 3[shall] be examined orally by the Court; and the Court may, if it thinks fit, put in the course of such examination questions suggested by either party. 3. Substance of examination to be written. The substance of the examination shall be reduced to writing by the Judge, and shall form part of the record. 4. Consequence of refusal or inability of pleader to answer. (1) Where the pleader of any party who appears by a pleader or any such person accompanying a pleader as is referred to in rule 2, refuses or is unable to answer any material question relating to the suit which the Court is of opinion that the party whom he represents ought to answer, and is likely to be able to answer if interrogated in person, the Court may postpone the hearing of the suit to a future day and direct that such party shall appear in person on such day. (2) If such party fails without lawful excuse to appear in person on the day so appointed, the Court may pronounce judgment against him, or make such order in relation to the suit as it thinks fit. ORDER XI DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION 1. Discovery by interrogatories. In any suit the plaintiff or defendant by leave of the Court may deliver interrogatories in writing for the examination of the opposite parties or any one or more of such parties, and such interrogatories when delivered shall have a note at the foot thereof stating which of such interrogatories each of such persons is required to answer: Provided that no party shall deliver more than 3Sub-rule (2) added by Ord. 10 of 1980, s. 14. 2Ins. by ord. 34 of 02, s.3. 3Subs. by Act XIV of 1994, s.11 one set of interrogatories to the same party without an order for that purpose: Provided also that interrogatories which do not relate to any matters in question in the suit shall be deemed irrelevant, notwithstanding that they might be admissible on the oral cross-examination of a witness. 2. Particular interrogatories to be submitted. On an application for leave to deliver interrogatories, the particular interrogatories proposed to be delivered shall be submitted to the Court. In deciding upon such application, the Court shall take into account any offer, which may be made by the party sought to be interrogated to deliver particulars, or to make admissions, or to produce documents relating to the matters in question, or any of them, and leave shall be given as to such only of the interrogatories submitted as the Court shall consider necessary either for disposing fairly of the suit or for saving costs. 3. Costs of interrogatories. In adjusting the costs of the suit inquiry shall at the instance of any party be made into the propriety of exhibiting such interrogatories, and if it is the opinion of the taxing officer or of the Court, either with or without an application for inquiry, that such interrogatories have been exhibited unreasonably, vexatiously, or at improper length, the costs occasioned by the said interrogatories and the answers thereto shall be paid in any event by the party in fault. 4. Forms of interrogatories. Interrogatories shall be in Form No.2 in Appendix C, with such variations as circumstances may require. 5. Corporations. Where any party to a suit is a corporation or a body of persons, whether incorporated or not, empowered by law to sue or be sued, whether in its own name or in the name of any officer or other person, any opposite party may apply for an order allowing him to deliver interrogatories to any member or officer of such corporation or body, and an order may be made accordingly. 6. Objections to interrogatories by answer. Any objection to answering any interrogatory on the ground that it is scandalous or irrelevant or not exhibited bona fide for the purpose of the suit, or that the matters inquired into are not sufficiently material at that stage, or on any other ground, may be taken in the affidavit in answer. 7. Setting aside and striking out interrogatories. Any interrogatories may be set aside on the ground that they have been exhibited unreasonably or vexatiously, or struck out on the ground that they are prolix, oppressive, unnecessary or scandalous; and any application for this purpose may be made within seven days after service of the interrogatories. 8. Affidavit in answer, filing. Interrogatories shall be answered by affidavit to be filed within ten days, or within such other time as the Court may allow. 9. Forms of affidavit in answer. An affidavit in answer to interrogatories shall be in Form No.3 in Appendix C, with such variations as circumstances may require. 10. No exception to be taken. No exception shall be taken to any affidavit in answer, but the sufficiency or otherwise of any such affidavit objected to as insufficient shall be determined by the Court. 11. Order to answer or answer further. Where any person interrogated omits to answer, or answers insufficiently, the party interrogating may apply to the Court for an order requiring him to answer, or to answer further, as the case may be. And an order may be made requiring him to answer or answer further, either by affidavit or by viva voce examination, as the Court may direct. 12. Application for discovery of documents. Any party may, without filing any affidavit, apply to the Court for an order directing any other party to any suit to make discovery on oath of the documents which are or have been in his possession or power, relating to any matter in question therein. On the hearing of such application the Court may either refuse or adjourn the same, if satisfied that such discovery is not necessary, or not necessary at that stage of the suit, or make such order, either generally or limited to certain classes of documents, as may, in its discretion, be thought fit: Provided that discovery shall not be ordered when and so far as the Court shall be of opinion that it is not necessary either for disposing fairly of the suit or for saving costs. 13. Affidavit of documents. The affidavit to be made by a party against whom such order as is mentioned in the last preceding rule has been made, shall specify which (if any) of the documents therein mentioned he objects to produce, and it shall be in Form No.5 in Appendix C, with such variations as circumstances may require. 14. Production of documents. It shall be lawful for the Court, at any time during the pendency of any suit, to order the production by any party thereto, upon oath, of such of the documents in his possession or power, relating to any matter in question in such suit, as the Court shall think right; and the Court may deal with such documents, when produced, in such manner as shall appear just. 15. Inspection of documents referred to in pleadings or affidavits. Every party to a suit shall be entitled at any time to give notice to any other party, in whose pleadings or affidavits reference is made to any document, to produce such document for the inspection of the party giving such notice, or of his pleader, and to permit him or them to take copies thereof; and any party not complying with such notice shall not afterwards be at liberty to put any such document in evidence on his behalf in such suit unless he shall satisfy the Court that such document relates only to his own title, he being a defendant to the suit, or that he had some other cause or excuse which the Court shall deem sufficient for not complying with such notice, in which case the Court may allow the same to be put in evidence on such terms as to costs and otherwise as the Court shall think fit. 16. Notice to produce. Notice to any party to produce any documents referred to in his pleading or affidavits shall be in Form No.7 in Appendix C, with such variations as circumstances may require. 17. Time for inspection when notice given. The party to whom such notice is given shall, within ten days from the receipt of such notice, deliver to the party giving the same a notice stating a time within three days from the delivery thereof at which the documents, or such of them as he does not object to produce, may be inspected at the office of his pleader, or in the case of bankers' books or other books of account or books in constant use for the purposes of any trade or business, at their usual place of custody, and stating which (if any) of the documents he objects to produce, and on what ground. Such notice shall be in Form No.8 in Appendix C, with such variations as circumstances may require. 18. Order for inspection. (1) Where the party served with notice under rule 15 omits to give such notice of a time for inspection or objects to give inspection, or offers inspection elsewhere than at the office of his pleader, the Court may, on the application of the party desiring it, make an order for inspection in such place and in such manner as it may think fit: Provided that the order shall not be made when and so far as the Court shall be of opinion that it is not necessary either for disposing fairly of the suit or for saving costs. (2) Any application to inspect documents, except such as are referred to in the pleadings, particulars or affidavits of the party against whom the application is made or disclosed in his affidavit of documents, shall be founded upon an affidavit showing of what documents inspection is sought, that the party applying is entitled to inspect them, and that they are in the possession or power of the other party. The Court shall not make such order for inspection of such documents when and so far as the Court shall be of opinion that it is not necessary either for disposing fairly of the suit or for saving costs. 19. Verified copies. (1) Where inspection of any business books is applied for the Court may, if it thinks fit, instead of ordering inspection of the original books, order a copy of any entries therein to be furnished and verified by the affidavit of some person who has examined the copy with the original entries, and such affidavit shall state whether or not there are in the original book any and what erasures, interlineations or alterations: Provided that, notwithstanding that such copy has been supplied, the Court may order inspection of the book from which the copy was made. (2) Where on an application for an order for inspection privilege is claimed for any document, it shall be lawful for the Court to inspect the document for the purpose of deciding as to the validity of the claim of privilege. (3) The Court may, on the application of any party to a suit at any time, and whether an affidavit of documents shall or shall not have already been ordered or made, make an order requiring any other party to state by affidavit whether any one or more specific documents, to be specified in the application, is or are, or has or have at any time been, in his possession or power; and, if not then in his possession, when he parted with the same and what has become thereof. Such application shall be made on an affidavit stated that in the belief of the deponent the party against whom the application is made has, or has at some time had, in his possession or power the document or documents specified in the application, and that they relate to the matters in question in the suit, or to some of them. 20. Premature discovery. Where the party from whom discovery of any kind or inspection is sought objects to the same, or any part thereof, the Court may, if satisfied that the right to the discovery or inspection sought depends on the determination of any issue or question in dispute in the suit, or that for any other reason it is desirable that any issue or question in dispute in the suit should be determined before deciding upon the right to the discovery or inspection, order that such issue or question be determined first, and reserve the question as to the discovery or inspection. 21. Non-compliance with order for discovery. Where any party fails to comply with any order to answer interrogatories, or for discovery or inspection of documents, he shall, if a plaintiff, be liable to have his suit dismissed for want of prosecution, and, if a defendant, to have his defence, if any, struck out, and to be placed in the same position as if he had not defended, and the party interrogating or seeking discovery or inspection may apply to the Court for an order to that effect, and an order may be made accordingly. 22. Using answers to interrogatories at trial. Any party may, at the trial of a suit, use in evidence any one or more of the answers or any part of an answer of the opposite party to interrogatories without putting in the others or the whole of such answer: Provided always that in such case the Court may look at the whole of the answers, and if it shall be of opinion that any others of them are so connected with those put in that the last-mentioned answers ought not to be used without them, it may direct them to be put in. 23. Order to apply to minors. This order shall apply to minor plaintiffs and defendants, and to the next friends and guardians for the suit of persons under disability. ORDER XII ADMISSIONS 1. Notice of admission of case. Any party to a suit may give notice, by his pleading, or otherwise in writing, that he admits the truth of the whole or any part of the case of any other party. 2. Notice to admit documents. Either party may call upon the other party to admit any document, saving all just exceptions; and in case of refusal or neglect to admit, after such notice, the costs of proving any such document shall be paid by the party so neglecting or refusing, whatever the result of the suit may be, unless the Court otherwise directs; and no costs of proving any document shall be allowed unless such notice is given, except where the omission to give the notice is, in the opinion of the Court, a saving of expense. 3.

Power of Court to record admission of documents and facts. Notwithstanding that no notice to admit documents or facts has been given under Rules 2 and 4 respectively, the Court may, at any stage of the proceedings before it, of its own motion, call upon any party to admit any document or fact and shall in such a case, record whether the party admits or refuses or neglects to admit such document or fact.] 5.

Affidavit of signature. An affidavit of the pleader or his clerk, of the due signature of any admissions made in pursuance of any notice to admit documents or facts, shall be sufficient evidence of such admissions, if evidence thereof is required. 1Added by No. 300 Rules/XI-Y-26, dated 2nd October, 2001. 8. Notice to produce documents. Notice to produce documents shall be in Form No.12 in Appendix C, with such variations as circumstances may require.

Costs. If a notice to admit or produce specifies documents which are not necessary, the costs occasioned thereby shall be borne by the party giving such notice. ORDER XIII PRODUCTION, IMPOUNDING AND RETURN OF DOCUMENTS 1. Documentary evidence to be produced at first hearing. (1) The parties or their pleaders shall produce, at the first hearing of the suit, all the documentary evidence of every description in their possession or power, on which they intend to rely, and which has not already been filed in Court, and all documents which the Court has ordered to be produced. (2) The Court shall receive the documents so produced: Provided that they are accompanied by an accurate list thereof prepared in such form as the High Court directs. 1[(3) On production of documents under this rule, the Court may call upon the parties to admit or deny the documents produced in the Court and record their admission or, as the case may be, denial.] 2. Effect of non-production of documents.

Endorsements on copies of admitted entries in books, accounts and records. (1) Save in so far as is otherwise provided by the Banker's Books Evidence Act, 1891 (XVIII of 1891), where a document admitted in evidence in the suit is an entry in a letter-book, or a shop-book or other account in current use, the party on whose behalf the book or account is produced may furnish a copy of the entry. (2) Where such a document is an entry in a public record produced from a public office, or by a public officer, or an entry in a book or account belonging to a person other than a party on whose behalf the book, or account is produced, the Court may require a copy of the entry to be furnished (a) where the record, book or account is produced on behalf of a party, then by that party, or (b) where the record, book or account is produced in obedience to an order of the Court acting of its own motion, then by either or any party. (3) Where a copy of an entry is furnished under the foregoing provisions of this rule, the Court shall, after causing the copy to be examined, compared and certified in manner mentioned in rule 17 of Order VII, mark the entry and cause he book, account or record in which it occurs to be returned to the person producing it. 6.

(3) Nothing contained in this rule shall be deemed to enable the Court to use in evidence any document which under the law of evidence would be inadmissible in the suit. 11. Provisions as to documents applied to material objects. The provisions herein contained as to documents shall, so far as may be, apply to all other material objects producible as evidence. ORDER XIV SETTLEMENT OF ISSUES AND DETERMINATION OF SUIT ON ISSUES OF LAW OR ON ISSUES AGREED UPON 1. Framing of issues. (1) Issues arise when a material proposition of fact or law is affirmed by the one party and denied by the other. (2) Material propositions are those propositions of law or fact which a plaintiff must allege in order to show a right to sue or a defendant must allege in order to constitute his defence. (3) Each material proposition affirmed by one party and denied by the other shall form the subject of a distinct issue. (4) Issues are of two kinds: (a) issues of fact, (b) issues of law. (5) At the first hearing of the suit the Court shall, after reading the plaint and the written statements if any, and after such examination of the parties as may appear necessary, ascertain upon what material propositions of fact or of law the parties are at variance, and shall thereupon proceed to frame and record the issues on which the right decision of the case appears to depend. (6) Nothing in this rule requires the Court to frame and record issues where the defendant at the first hearing of the suit makes no defence. 2. Issue of law and fact. Where issues both of law and of fact arise in the same suit, and the Court is of opinion that the case or any part thereof may be disposed of on the issues of law only, it shall try those issues first, and for that purpose may, if it thinks fit, postpone the settlement of the issues of fact until after the issues of law have been determined. 3. Materials from which issues may be framed. The Court may frame the issues from all or any of the following materials (a) allegations made on oath by the parties, or by any persons present on their behalf, or made by the pleaders of such parties; (b) allegations made in the pleadings or in answers to interrogatories delivered in the suit; (c) the contents of documents produced by either party. 4. Court may examine witnesses or documents before framing issues. Where the Court is of opinion that the issues cannot be correctly framed without the examination of some person not before the Court or without the inspection of some document not produced in the suit, it may adjourn the framing of the issues to a future day, and may (subject to any law for the time being in force) compel the attendance of any person or the production of any document by the person in whose possession or power it is by summons or other process. 5. Power to amend, and strike out, issues. (1) The Court may at any time before passing a decree amend the issues or frame additional issues on such terms as it thinks fit,. and all such amendments or additional issues as may be necessary for determining the matters in controversy between the parties shall be so made or framed. (2) The Court may also, at any time before passing a decree, strike out any issues that appear to it to be wrongly framed or introduced. 6. Questions of fact or law may by agreement be stated in form of issues. Where the parties to a suit are agreed as to the question of fact or of law to be decided between them, they may state the same in the form of an issue, and enter into an agreement in writing that, upon the finding of the Court in the affirmative or the negative of such issue, (a) a sum of money specified in the agreement or to be ascertained by the Court, or in such manner as the Court may direct, shall be paid by one of the parties to the other of them, or that one of them be declared entitled to some right or subject to some liability specified in the agreement; (b) some property specified in the agreement and in dispute in the suit shall be delivered by one of the parties to the other of them, or as that other may direct; or (c) One or more of the parties shall do or abstain from doing some particular act specified in the agreement and relating to the matter in dispute. 7. Court, if satisfied that agreement was executed in good faith, may pronounce judgment. Where the Court is satisfied, after making such inquiry as it deems proper, (a) that the agreement was duly executed by the parties, (b) that they have a substantial interest in the decision of such question as aforesaid, and (c) that the same is fit to be tried and decided, it shall proceed to record and try the issue and state its finding or decision thereon in the same manner as if the issue had been framed by the Court; And shall, upon the finding or decision on such issue, pronounce judgment according to the terms of the agreement; and, upon the judgment so pronounced, a decree shall follow. ORDER XV DISPOSAL OF THE SUIT AT THE FIRST HEARING 1. Parties not at issue. Where at the first hearing of a suit it appears that the parties are not at issue on any question of law or of fact, the Court may at once pronounce judgment. 2. One of several a defendants not at issue. Where there are more defendants than one, and any one of the defendants is not at issue with the plaintiff on any question of law or of fact, the Court may at once pronounce judgment for or against such defendant and the suit shall proceed only against the other defendants. 3. Parties at issue. (1) Where the parties are at issue on some question of law or of fact, and issues have been framed by the Court as hereinbefore provided, if the Court is satisfied that no further argument or evidence than the parties can at once adduce is required upon such of the issues as may be sufficient for the decision of the suit, and that no injustice will result from proceeding with the suit forthwith, the Court may proceed to determine such issues, and, if the finding thereon is sufficient for the decision, may pronounce judgment accordingly, whether the summons has been issued for the settlement of issues only or for the final disposal of the suit: Provided that, where the summons has been issued for the settlement of issues only, the parties or their pleaders are present and none of them objects. (2) Where the finding is not sufficient for the decision, the Court shall postpone the further hearing of the suit, and shall fix a day for the production of such further evidence, or for such further argument as the case requires. 4. Failure to provide evidence. Where the summons has been issued for the final disposal of the suit and either party fails without sufficient cause to produce the evidence on which he relies, the Court may at once pronounce judgment, or may, if it thinks fit, after framing and recording issues adjourn the suit for the production of such evidence as may be necessary for its decision upon such issues. ORDER XVI SUMMONING AND ATTENDANCE OF WITNESSES 1[1. Summons to attend to give evidence or produce documents. (1) Not later than seven days after the settlement of issues, the parties shall present in Court a 2[, certificate of readiness to produce evidence, along with a] list of witnesses whom they propose to call or produce either to give evidence or to produce documents. (2) A party shall not be permitted to call or produce witnesses other than those contained in the said list, except with the permission of the Court and after showing good cause for the omission the said witnesses from the list; and the Court grants such permission, it shall record reasons for so doing. (3) On application to the Court or such officer as it appoints in this behalf, the parties may obtain summons for persons whose attendance is required in Court: Provided that no summons shall be issued for service on a person under rule 8 unless an application in that behalf is made not later than fourteen days prior to the date fixed for the hearing of the suit and the necessary expenses for the summoning of such person are deposited] 2. Expenses of witness to be paid into Court on applying for summons. (1) The party applying for a summons shall, before the summons is granted and within a period to be fixed, pay into Court such a sum of money as appears to the Court to be sufficient to defray the travelling and other expenses of the person summoned in passing to and from the Court in which he is required to attend, and for one day's attendance. (2) Experts. In determining the amount payable under this rule, the Court may, in the case of any person summoned to give evidence as an expert, allow reasonable remuneration for the time occupied both in giving evidence and in performing any work of an expert character necessary for the case. (3) Scale of expenses. Where the Court is subordinate to a High Court, regard shall be had, in fixing the scale of such expenses, to any rules made in that behalf. 3. Tender of expenses to witness. The sum so paid into Court shall be tendered to the person summoned, at the time of serving the summons, if it can be served personally. 4. Procedure where insufficient sum paid in. (1) Where it appears to the Court or to such officer as it appoints in this behalf that the sum paid into Court is not sufficient to cover such expenses or reasonable remuneration, the Court may direct such further sum to be paid to the person summoned as appears to be necessary on that account, and, in case of default in payment, may order such sum to be levied by attachment and sale of the moveable property of the party obtaining the summons ; or the Court may discharge the person summoned, without requiring him to give evidence ; or may both order such levy and discharge such person as aforesaid. (2) Expenses of witness detained more than one day. Where it is necessary to detain the person summoned for a longer period than one day, the Court may, from time to time, order the party at whose instance he was summoned to pay into Court such sum as is sufficient to defray the expenses of his 1Subs. by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972), s.2 and Sch., for the original rule 1. 2Ins. by Act. XIV of 1994, S.11. detention for such further period, and, in default of such deposit being made, may order such sum to be levied by attachment and sale of the movable property of such party ; or the Court may discharge the person summoned without requiring him to give evidence; or may both order such levy and discharge such person as aforesaid. 5. Time, place and purpose of attendance to be specified in summons. Every summons for the attendance of a person to give evidence or to produce a document shall specify the time and place at which he is required to attend, and also whether his attendance is required for the purpose of giving evidence or to produce a document, or for both purposes; and any particular document which the person summoned is called on to produce, shall be described in the summons with reasonable accuracy. 6. Summons to produce document. Any person may be summoned to produce a document, without being summoned to give evidence; and any person summoned merely to produce a document shall be deemed to have complied with the summons if he causes such document to be produced instead of attending personally to produce the same. 7. Power to require persons present in Court to give evidence or produce document. Any person present in Court may be required by the Court to give evidence or to produce any document then and there in his possession or power. 1[7A. Service of summons by parties. (1) Except where it appears to the Court that a summons under this Order should be served by the Court in the same manner as a summons to a defendant, the Court shall make over for service all summons under this Order to the party applying therefore. (2) The service shall be effected by or on behalf of such party by delivering or tendering to the witness in person a copy thereof signed by the Judge or such officer as he appoints in this behalf and sealed with the seal of the Court. (3) Rules 16 and 18 of Order V shall apply to summons personally served under this rule, as though the person effecting service were a serving officer.]. 2[8. Service of summons by Court. Every summons under this Order, not being a summons made over to a party for service under rule 7A of this Order, shall be served as nearly as may be in the same manner as a summons to a defendant, and the rules in Order V as to proof of service shall apply thereto.]. 9. Time for serving summons. Service shall in all cases be made a sufficient time before the time specified in the summons for the attendance of the person summoned, to allow him a reasonable time for preparation and for travelling to the place at which his attendance is required. 10. Procedure where witness fails to comply with summons.

(2) Where the Court sees sufficient cause for allowing the decree to be executed on an application made under this rule, it shall make such order as it deems necessary for protecting the interests of the persons who have not joined in the application. 16. Application for execution by transferee of decree.

(2) This rule shall be deemed to apply where either party is an assignee of one of the decrees and as well in respect of judgment-debts due by the original assignor as in respect of judgment-debts due by the assignee himself. (3) This rule shall not be deemed to apply unless (a) the decree-holder in one of the suits in which the decrees have been made is the judgment- debtor in the other and each party fills the same character in both suits; and (b) the sums due under the decree are definite.

Act, 1937 (8 of 1937), section 3. made on any previous application for execution, or in consequence of the application being made against the legal representative of the judgment-debtor, if upon a previous application for execution against the same person the Court has ordered execution to issue against him. (2) Nothing in the foregoing sub-rule shall be deemed to preclude the Court from issuing any process in execution of a decree without issuing the notice thereby prescribed, if, for reasons to be recorded, it considers that the issue of such notice would cause unreasonable delay or would defeat the ends of justice. 23. Procedure after issue of notice. (1) Where the person to whom notice is issued under the last preceding rule does not appear or does not show cause to the satisfaction of the Court why the decree should not be executed, the Court shall order the decree to be executed. (2) Where such person offers any objection to the execution of the decree, the Court shall consider such objection and make such order as it thinks fit. 1[Objection to Execution 23-A. Deposit of decretal amount, etc. An objection by the judgment-debtor to the execution of a decree shall not be considered by the Court unless (a) in the case of a decree for the payment of money, he either deposits the decretal amount in Court or furnishes security for its payment; and (b) in the case of any other decree, he furnishes security for the due performance of the decree.].

(1) The officer entrusted with the execution of the process shall endorse thereon the day on, and the manner in, which it was executed, and, if the latest day specified in the process for the return thereof has been exceeded, the reason of the delay, or, if it was not executed, the reason why it was not executed, and shall return the process with such endorsement to the Court. (2) Where the endorsement is to the effect that such officer is unable to execute the process, the Court shall examine him touching his alleged inability, and may, if it thinks fit, summon and examine witnesses as to such inability, and shall record the result. 1Rule 23A and heading ins. by the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (12 of 1972), s.2 and Sch.

(2) Where the property or person of the judgment-debtor has been seized under an execution the Court which issued the execution may order the restitution of such property or the discharge of such person pending the result of the application. 1[* * * * * * *] 27.

Stay of execution pending suit between decree-holder and judgment-debtor. Where a suit is pending in any Court against the holder of a decree of such Court, on the part of the person against whom the decree was passed, the Court may, on such terms as to security or otherwise, as it thinks fit, stay execution of the decree until the pending suit has been decided. Mode of Execution 30. Decree for payment of money.

Decree for specific moveable property. (1) Where the decree is for any specific moveable, or for any share in a specific moveable, it may be executed by the seizure, if practicable, of the moveable or share, and by the delivery thereof to the party to whom it has been adjudged, or to such person as he appoints to receive delivery on his behalf, or by the detention in 2[* * *] prison of the judgment-debtor, or by the attachment of his property, or by both.

(2) Where the party against whom a decree for specific performance or for an injunction has been passed is a corporation, the decree may be enforced by the attachment of the property of the corporation, or, with the leave of the Court, by the detention in 2[* * *] prison of the directors or other principal officers thereof, or by both attachment and detention. (3) Where any attachment under sub-rule (1) or sub-rule (2) has remained in force for one year, if the judgment-debtor has not obeyed the decree and the decree-holder has applied to have the attached property sold, such property may be sold ; and out of the proceeds the Court may award to the decree­ holder such compensation as it thinks fit, and shall pay the balance (if any) to the judgment-debtor on his application. (4) Where the judgment debtor has obeyed the decree and paid all costs of executing the same which he is bound to pay, or where, at the end of one year from the date of the attachment, no application to have the property sold has been made, or if made has been refused, the attachment shall cease.

Illustration A, a person of little substance, erects a building which renders uninhabitable a family mansion belonging to B. A, in-spite of his detention in prison and the attachment of his property, declines to obey a decree obtained against him by B and directing him to remove the building. The Court is of opinion that no sum realizable by the sale of A's property would adequately compensate B for the depreciation in the value of his mansion. B may apply to the Court to remove the building and may recover the cost of such removal from A in the execution-proceedings. 1Ins. by the Code of Civil Procedure (Amdt.)

Mode of making proclamation. (1) Every proclamation shall be made and published, as nearly as may be, in the manner prescribed by rule 54, sub-rule (2).

Irregularity not to vitiate sale, but any person injured may sue. No irregularity in publishing or conducting the sale of moveable property shall vitiate the sale; but any person sustaining any injury by reason of such irregularity at the hand of any other person may institute a suit against him for compensation or (if such other person is the purchaser) for the recovery of the specific property and for compensation in default of such recovery. 79. Delivery of moveable property, debts and shares. (1) Where the property sold is moveable property of which actual seizure has been made, it shall be delivered to the purchaser. (2) Where the property sold is moveable property in the possession of some person other than the judgment-debtor, the delivery thereof to the purchaser shall be made by giving notice to the person in possession prohibiting him from delivering possession of the property to any person except the purchaser.

Transfer of negotiable instruments and shares. (1) Where the execution of a document or the endorsement of the party in whose name a negotiable instrument or a share in a corporation is standing is required to transfer such negotiable instrument or share, the Judge or such officer as he may appoint in this behalf may execute such document or make such endorsement as may be necessary, and such execution or endorsement shall have the same effect as an execution or endorsement by the party. (2) Such execution or endorsement may be in the following form, namely: A.B by C.D., Judge of the Court of (or as the case may be), in a suit by E.F against A.B. (3) Until the transfer of such negotiable instrument or share, the Court may, by order, appoint some person to receive any interest or divided due thereon and to sign a receipt for the same; and any receipt so signed shall be as valid and effectual for all purposes as if the same had been signed by the party himself. 80. Vesting order in case of other property. In case of any moveable property not hereinbefore provided for, the Court may make an order vesting such property in the purchaser or as he may direct; and such property shall vest accordingly.

Postponement of sale to enable judgment debtor to raise amount of decree.

(2) In such case the Court shall grant a certificate to the judgment-debtor authorizing him within a period to be mentioned therein, and notwithstanding anything contained in section 64, to make the proposed mortgage, lease or sale: Provided that all monies payable under such mortgage, lease or sale shall be paid, not to the judgment-debtor, but, save in so far as a decree-holder is entitled to set off such money under the provisions of rule 72, into Court: Provided also that no mortgage, leases or sale under this rule shall become absolute until it has been confirmed by the Court.

Time for payment in full of purchase money. The full amount of purchase-money payable shall be paid by the purchaser into Court before the Court closes on the fifteenth day from the sale of the property: Provided that, in calculating the amount to be so paid into Court, the purchaser shall have the advantage of any set-off to which he may be entitled under rule 72. 86. Procedure in default of payment. In default of payment within the period mentioned in the last preceding rule, the deposit may, if the Court thinks fit, after defraying the expenses of the sale, be forfeited to the Government, and the property shall be re-sold, and the defaulting purchaser shall forfeit all claim to the property or to any part of the sum for which it may subsequently be sold. 87.

Application to set aside sale on ground of irregularity or fraud. (1) Where any immoveable property has been sold in execution of a decree, the decree-holder, or any person entitled to share in a rateable distribution of assets, or whose interests are affected by the sale, may apply to the Court to set aside the sale on the ground of a material irregularity or fraud in publishing or conducting it: Provided that no sale shall be set aside on the ground of irregularity or fraud unless upon the facts proved the Court is satisfied that the applicant has sustained substantial injury by reason of such irregularity or fraud [:]1 2[Provided further that no such application shall be entertained unless the applicant deposits such amount, not exceeding twenty per cent of the sum realised at the sale, or furnishes such security, as the Court may direct.] 91.

(1) Where the plaintiff accepts such amount as satisfaction in part only of his claim, he may prosecute his suit for the balance; and, if the court decides that the deposit by the defendant was a full satisfaction of the plaintiff's claim, the plaintiff shall pay the costs of the suit incurred after the deposit and the costs incurred previous thereto, so far as they were caused by excess in the plaintiff’s claim.

On the plaint being filed, A pays the money into Court. B accepts it in full satisfaction of his claim, but the Court should not allow him any costs, the litigation being presumably groundless on his part. (b) B sues A under the circumstances mentioned in illustration (a). On the plaint being filed. A disputes the claim. Afterwards A pays the money into Court. B accepts it in full satisfaction of his claim. The Court should also give B his costs of suit, A’s conduct having shown that the litigation was necessary. (c) A owes B Rs 100, and is willing to pay him that sum without suit. B claims Rs.150 and sues A for that amount. On the plaint being filed A pays Rs.100 into Court and disputes only his liability to pay the remaining Rs. 50. B accepts the Rs. 100 in full satisfaction of his claim.

Effect of failure to furnish security. (1) In the event of such security not being furnished within the time fixed, the Court shall make an order dismissing the suit unless the plaintiff or plaintiffs are permitted to withdraw therefrom. (2) Where a suit is dismissed under this rule, the plaintiff may apply for an order to set the dismissal aside, and, if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Court that he was prevented by any sufficient cause from furnishing the security within the time allowed, the Court shall set aside the dismissal upon such terms as to security, costs or otherwise as it thinks fit, and shall appoint a day for proceeding with the suit. (3) The dismissal shall not be set aside unless notice of such application has been served on the defendant. ORDER XXVI COMMISSIONS Commissions to Examine Witnesses 1.

Refusal to allow applicant to sue as pauper to bar subsequent application of like nature. An order refusing to allow the applicant to sue as a pauper shall be a bar to any subsequent application of the like nature by him in respect of the same right to sue; but the applicant shall be at liberty to institute a suit in the ordinary manner in respect of such right, provided that he first pays the costs (if any) incurred by the 2[Provincial Government] and by the opposite party in opposing his application for leave to sue as a pauper. 16.

[Arbitration] Rep. by the Arbitration Act, 1940 (X of 1940), s. 49 and Third Schedule THE THIRD SCHEDULE (See section 69) EXECUTION OF DECREES BY COLLECTORS 1. Powers of Collector. Where the execution of a decree has been transferred to the Collector under section 68, he may (a) proceed as the Court would proceed when the sale of immoveable property is postponed in order to enable the judgment-debtor to raise the amount of the decree ; or (b) raise the amount of the decree by letting in perpetuity, or for a term on payment of a premium, or by mortgaging, the whole or any part of the property ordered to be sold ; or (c) sell the property ordered to be sold or so much thereof as may be necessary. 2. Procedure of Collector in special cases. Where the execution of a decree, not being a decree ordering the sale of immoveable property in pursuance of a contract specifically affecting the same, but being a decree for the payment of money in satisfaction of which the Court has ordered the sale of immoveable property, has been so transferred, the Collector, if, after such inquiry as he thinks necessary, he has reason to believe that all the liabilities of the judgment-debtor can be discharged without a sale of the whole of his available immoveable property, may proceed as hereinafter provided. 3. Notice to be given to decree holders and to persons having claims on property. (1) In any such case as is referred to in paragraph 2, the Collector shall publish a notice, allowing a period of sixty days from the date of its publication for compliance and calling upon (a) every person holding a decree for the payment of money against the judgment-debtor capable of execution by sale of his immoveable property and which such decree holder desires to have so executed, and every holder of a decree for the payment of money in execution of which proceedings for the sale of such property are pending, to produce before the Collector a copy of the decree, and a certificate from the Court which passed or is executing the same, declaring the amount recoverable thereunder ; (b) every person having any claim on the said property to submit to the Collector a statement of such claim, and to produce the documents (if any) by which it is evidenced. (2) Such notice shall be published by being affixed on a conspicuous part of the Court-house of the Court which made the original order for sale, and in such other places (if any) as the Collector thinks fit ; and where the address of any such decree­holder or claimant is known, a copy of the notice shall be sent to him by post or otherwise. 4. Amount of decrees for payment of money to be ascertained, and immoveable property available for their satisfaction. (1) Upon the expiration of the said period, the Collector shall appoint a day for hearing any representations which the judgment-debtor and the decree-holders or claimants (if any) may desire to make, and for holding such inquiry as he may deem necessary for informing himself as to the nature and extent of such decrees and claims and of the judgment-debtor's immoveable property, and may, from time to time, adjourn such hearing and inquiry. (2) Where there is no dispute as to the fact or extent of the liability of the judgment-debtor to any of the decrees or claims of which the Collector is informed, or as to the relative priorities of such decrees or claims, or as to the liability of any such property for the satisfaction of such decrees or claims, the Collector shall draw up a statement, specifying the amount to be recovered for the discharge of such decrees, the order in which such decrees and claims are to be satisfied, and the immoveable property available for that purpose. (3) Where any such dispute arises, the Collector shall refer the same, with a statement thereof and his own opinion thereon, to the Court which made the original order for sale, and shall, pending the reference, stay proceedings relating to the subject thereof. The Court shall dispose of the dispute if the matter thereof is within its jurisdiction, or transmit the case to a competent Court for disposal, and the final decision shall be communicated to the Collector, who shall then draw up a statement as above provided in accordance with such decision. 5. Where District Court may issue notices and hold inquiry. The Collector may, instead of himself issuing the notices and holding the inquiry required by paragraphs 3 and 4, draw up a statement specifying the circumstances of the judgment-debtor and of his immoveable property so far as they are known to the Collector or appear in the records of his office, and forward such statement to the District Court ; and such Court shall thereupon issue the notices, hold the inquiry and draw up the statement required by paragraphs 3 and 4 and transmit such statement to the Collector. 6. Effect of decision of Court as to dispute. The decision by the Court of any dispute arising under paragraph 4 or paragraph 5 shall, as between the parties thereto, have the force of and be appealable as a decree. 7. Scheme for liquidation of decrees for payment of money. (1) Where the amount to be recovered and the property available have been determined as provided in paragraph 4 or paragraph 5, the Collector may, (a) if it appears that the amount cannot be recovered without the sale of the whole of the property available, proceed to sell such property ; or (b) if it appears that the amount with interest (if any) in accordance with the decree, and, when not decreed, with interest (if any) at such rate as he thinks reasonable, may be recovered without such sale, raise such amount and interest (notwithstanding the original order for sale) (i) by letting in perpetuity or for a term, on payment of a premium, the whole or any part of the said property ; or (ii) by mortgaging the whole or any part of such property ; or (iii) by selling part of such property ; or (iv) by letting on farm, or managing by himself or another, the whole or any part of such property for any term not exceeding twenty years from the date of the order of sale ; or (v) partly by one of such modes, and partly by another or others of such modes.
