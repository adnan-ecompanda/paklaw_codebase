Avoidance of jurisdiction of Courts and authorities over transferable prisoners.___(1) Upon the delivery of custody of a transferable prisoner in compliance with a warrant issued under section 3 to the person, being an official of 1* * * India or of any Province thereof or of any State that has acceded thereto, all Courts and authorities whatsoever in Pakistan shall cease to have and exercise jurisdiction in relation to such prisoner, in respect of the offence or other matter which was the cause of his confinement or detention in any Province of Pakistan.

(2) A warrant under sub‑section (1) may be directed to an official, by name or designation of office, and shall specify the place at which custody of the repatriated prisoner, together with any property and documents which may have been sent along with him, shall be received, and the prison to which he is to be removed. 8. Delivery of repatriated prisoner at prison. Upon presentation of a warrant issued under section 7, the Officer‑in‑Charge of the prison specified therein shall receive such repatriated prisoner and any property and documents which may be produced along with him, and (a) Detention where warrant is received with prisoner. where a warrant, writ or order of commitment to any prison or place of detention in which he was held immediately before repatriation is produced along with such prisoner, shall detain him according to the exigency of such warrant, writ or order, subject to any warrant, writ or order which may be issued thereafter in respect of such prisoner by any Court or authority exercising jurisdiction under the provisions of this Part, and (b) Detention where no warrant is received with prisoner. where no warrant, writ or order of commitment is produced along with such prisoner, such Officer- in‑Charge shall forthwith report the case, with all necessary details, to the District Magistrate and to the High Court, and shall in the meantime detain such prisoner. 9. Missing warrant to be reconstructed.___(1) Upon receipt of a report under clause (b) of section 8, the District Magistrate shall, with all convenient speed, procure the records (including judicial records) relating to such prisoner, and after such enquiry as he deems necessary, shall determine the nature and term of the detention which such prisoner was undergoing immediately before his repatriation, and shall draw up a warrant accordingly, commiting such prisoner to the prison where he is detained for the balance of such term, or until further orders are received from any Court or authority having jurisdiction in the case. (2) Report to High Court. Such warrant of commitment shall be forwarded to the Officer‑in‑Charge of the said prison, and the District Magistrate shall, at the same time, forward the original record, or a complete copy of his proceedings to the High Court. (3) Bail in case of delay. If any enquiry under sub‑section (1) is prolonged beyond a period of two months from the date on which the repatriated prisoner was received at the prison, the District Magistrate shall release such prisoner on bail, unless he has reason to believe that such prisoner has been convicted of a prescribed offence and is undergoing a sentence of which the balance exceeds two years. (4) The bail bond required under sub‑section (3) may be with or without sureties and shall be in such form as may be prescribed. 10. High Court’s jurisdiction. The High Court shall have, in relation to a repatriated prisoner, the same jurisdiction which it has in relation to a person who has been arrested or detained within the limits of its appellate jurisdiction, in the same circumstances in which such prisoner was arrested or detained in 1* * * India immediately before his repatriation. 11. Entrustment of case to Courts sub-ordinate to the High Court.___(1) The Provincial Governments may, in respect of any repatriated prisoner or any class or group of repatriated prisoners by order specify the Court, other than the High Court, which shall have or exercise jurisdiction in any case or cases which may have been pending against such prisoner or prisoners, immediately before his or their repatriation: Provided that such Court shall be a Court which would have had jurisdiction to enquire into or try such case or cases, if the offence or offences involved had been committed within its jurisdiction. (2) On the making of an order under sub‑section (1) every case mentioned in such order shall be deemed to have been transferred for disposal to the Court specified in such order, and such Court shall proceed to hear and decide upon such case according to law, as if the offence to which it relates had been committed within the local limits of its jurisdiction, and all the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898) (including the provisions relating to appeal and revision) and of all other laws in force in the Province 2* * * shall apply to such proceedings. (3) Evidence already recorded to be evidence in the case. In any proceedings under sub‑section (2), all evidence, both oral and documentary, which has been duly received in the earlier proceedings against the repatriated prisoner held prior to his repatriation may, if duly authenticated, be received as evidence, for the same purposes as it may have been received if it had been recorded by a Court exercising similar jurisdiction in 1* * * Pakistan. (4) Exhibits, depositions and copies thereof shall be deemed to be duly authenticated if they purport to be duly signed, verified or certified by a judge or Magistrate having jurisdiction at the place, where the earlier proceedings against the repatriated prisoner, prior to his repatriation, were held. 12. Treatment of prisoners who are repatriated while in police custody.___(1) The Provincial Governments may, in respect of any repatriated prisoner who, immediately before repatriation was held under arrest or detention in police custody, during or after completion of a police investigation, specify a Magistrate of the first class who shall have and exercise jurisdiction. (2) Every repatriated prisoner, in respect of whom an order has been made under sub‑section (1) shall be produced without delay before the Magistrate specified in the order, and such Magistrate may take cognizance of any offence that such repatriated prisoner may be reported by a police officer to have committed, and may grant him bail. 1Omitted by A.O., 1961, Art. 2 and Sch. (with effect from the 23rd March, 1956). 2Omitted by the Federal Laws (Revision and Declaration) Ordinance No. XXVII of 1981, s. 3 and Sch. II. (3) Where the repatriation was effected before completion of the police investigation, or the Magistrate is of the opinion that the evidence is deficient, the repatriated prisoner shall be released upon his entering into a bond with or without sureties as the Magistrate may direct, to appear if and when so required, and in the meantime, the Magistrate may order such further enquiry into the substance of the allegations as he thinks fit. (4) In every case falling under sub‑section (3), the Magistrate may, if he is satisfied at any stage that there is no prospect of securing sufficient evidence to justify commencement of proceedings against the repatriated prisoner, direct that such prisoner be discharged from his bond. 13. Bar to proceedings.___(1) No proceedings shall be taken against a repatriated prisoner unless the offence for which he has been arrested or detained is also an offence under the law in force in Pakistan or in the Province thereof to which he has been repatriated. (2) Prior sanction for prosecution. Where the offence charged against a repatriated prisoner is one for which a prosecution could not have been instituted in 1* * * India or, if the offence had been committed in Pakistan, in any Court in Pakistan, without the sanction of an authority specified by the relevant laws, no prosecution shall be instituted against such prisoner, nor shall any proceedings be commenced or continued against him without the sanction of the authority specified for the purpose by the law in force in the Province or, failing such authority, of the 1[2[Federal Government] or] the Provincial Government. 14. Power of provincial Governments in relation to prisoners detained for reasons of security. In relation to any repatriated prisoner whose detention immediately before his repatriation had been ordered under any law authorising preventive detention for reasons connected with public order the 2[Federal Government] or the Provincial Government shall have the same power in respect of extension or reduction of the term of detention as it possesses in relation to persons detained for reasons of security or under any law for the time being in force for preserving the public safety or security. 15. Power of Government to suspend, remit or commute sentences. The 2[Federal Government] or Provincial Government shall have the same power to suspend, remit or commute a sentence of punishment awarded to a repatriated prisoner, whether before or after his repatriation, as it possesses in relation to persons who have been sentenced in 1[Pakistan] or the Province for offences committed within 3[Pakistan] or the Province. 16. Power of Courts to grant bail. The High Courts and every Court specified by the Provincial Government under section 11 shall have, in respect of any repatriated prisoner who is rendered subject to the jurisdiction of such Court under the provisions of this Part, the same power of granting bail under the Code of Criminal Procedure (V of 1898), as such Courts would have had if such prisoner had been arrested or detained in the first instance in Pakistan. 1Omitted and subs. by A.O., 1961, Art. 2 and Sch.
