(3) When a Treasurer of Charitable Endowments is divested, by a direction of 4[the appropriate Government] under this section, of any property, it shall vest in the person or persons acting in the administration thereof and be held by him or them on the same trusts as those on which it was held by such Treasurer. 11.

Transfer of property from one Treasurer to another. If by reason of any alteration of areas or by reason of the appointment of a Treasurer of Charitable Endowments for 7[Pakistan] or for any Province for which such a Treasurer has not previously been appointed or for any other reason it appears to the 8[Federal Government] that any property vested in a Treasurer of Charitable Endowments should be vested in another such Treasurer, that Government may direct that the property shall be so vested and thereupon it shall vest in that other Treasurer and his successors as fully and effectually for the purposes of this Act as if it had been originally vested in him under this Act .] 9[13.Power to frame forms and make rules. 10[* * * * * * *] 1Subs. by A.
