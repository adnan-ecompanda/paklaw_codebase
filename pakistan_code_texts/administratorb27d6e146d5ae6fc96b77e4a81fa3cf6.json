Eviction of out-going lessees and unauthorized occupants from land.—(1) If, on the expiry, whether before or after the commencement of this Ordinance, of the period of any lease in respect of any land or building of which a Port Authority is the lessor, or on the determination of such lease on the ground of breach of any covenant or in pursuance of a condition in the lease imposing any obligation on the lessee to give up possession of the demised land or building in the event of such land or building being required for the purposes of a Port Authority, the lessee refused or failed, or refuses or fails, to vacate and deliver vacant possession of such land or building to the Port Authority, then, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any contract, such Port Authority may, by notice in writing, require such lessee to vacate and deliver vacant possession of such land or building, and to remove structures, if any, erected or built thereon by him, within such time as may be specified in the notice. (2) If the Port Authority is satisfied, after making such enquiry as it may think fit, that a person is an unauthorised occupant of any land or building, it may, by notice in writing, require such person to vacate such land or building, and deliver vacant possession thereof to it, and to remove structures, if any, erected or built thereon by him, within such time as may be specified in the notice.

Recovery of cost of demolition of structures.—(1) The cost of demolition of structures under section 3 or section 4, thereafter in this section referred to as the cost, shall be payable to the Port Authority by the lessee or the unauthorized occupant evicted. (2) If the cost is not paid on demand, the Authorized Officer may, on an application made in this behalf by the Port Authority, and after giving the lessee or the unauthorized occupant an op- portunity of being heard, cause the materials of the structures demolished to be sold in auction in such manner as may be prescribed. (3) If the proceeds of the sale under sub-section (2) are not sufficient to cover the cost, the balance shall be recoverable as arrears of land revenue and, if such proceeds exceed the cost, the excess shall be paid to the lessee or the unauthorized occupant. 8.
