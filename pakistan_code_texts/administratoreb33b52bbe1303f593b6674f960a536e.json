Uncertified film not to be exhibited.―(1) No person shall make or arrange a public or private exhibition of a film by means of cinematograph unless the film has been duly certified for public exhibition by the Board, provided that nothing in this sub-section shall be deemed to apply to the exhibition, in the residential premises of any person, of a film which only records events in the life of such person or any member of his family. (2) Any person desiring to submit any film for certification for public exhibition shall, in the prescribed manner, make an application to the Board for a certificate in respect thereof along with its re-recording, print or such equivalent material as the Board may determine, including sound tracks of speech, songs, music and effect, and the Board may, after examining the film, or having it examined, in the prescribed manner:― (a) sanction the film for unrestricted public exhibition ; or (b) sanction the film for such restricted public exhibition as may be prescribed ; or (c) direct the applicant to carry out such excisions in the film as the Board considers necessary before sanctioning the film for unrestricted or restricted public exhibitions; or (d) refuse to sanction the film for public exhibition.
